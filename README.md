## Synopsis

A very simple debugging utility for Xamarin.iOS apps that prints on console a list of opened files by the mobile application.

## Motivation

The latest XCode Instruments lack of File Activity tool to inspect opened file in iOS but only in Mac OS. This projects binds the framework generated [here](https://github.com/sanandrea/FileCounter) in a C# `.dll` that can be used directly in a Xamarin project.
I used the follwong [Guide](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/macios/binding/objective-sharpie/platform-features/native-frameworks/) to create the binding.

## Installation

Open Project in Xamarin and build it. The output binary is under the `build` folder.

## Code Example

Add library to a Xamarin.iOS app. Import dll in the source code file:

`using FileCounter.Xamarin;`

then use it in your code:

`FileCounter.Lsof()`
